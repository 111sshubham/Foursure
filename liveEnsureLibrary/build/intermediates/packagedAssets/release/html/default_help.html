            To authenticate using the LiveEnsure&reg; mobile app, simply scan the QR code presented by a
            participating website. If this is your first time authenticating with the site, you will be
            given a one-time PIN to enter. You will not need the PIN on subsequent visits.
        </p>

            You can purchase extra security measures for your app in the Store (in the navigation bar).
            Enabling the Location Control feature will limit successful sessions to a geographic region
            of your choosing.
        </p>
        <p>
            After successfully authenticating with a site, you can configure or reset your purchased features
            as well as reset any registered devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a purchased feature needs to be reset but you cannot authenticate with any participating site,
            simply uninstall the LiveEnsure&reg; mobile app and install it again from the cloud. This will
            cause another registration PIN to be generated and you will be able to restore your purchased
            features after authenticating.
